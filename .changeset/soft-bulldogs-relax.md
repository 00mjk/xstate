'xstate': patch
---

The JSON definition for `stateNode.invoke` objects will no longer include the `onDone` and `onError` transitions, since those transitions are already merged into the `transitions` array. This solves the issue of reviving a serialized machine from JSON, where before, the `onDone` and `onError` transitions for invocations were wrongly duplicated.
