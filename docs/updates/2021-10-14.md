# New Updates section

Welcome to the new Updates section of the documentation! We want to make it easy for you to keep up with the changes in our documentation, especially as we make improvements over the next few months. We will also add much more documentation to help you get started with XState.

Each update we will let you know what has changed, whatâ€™s new, and if any content is removed.
