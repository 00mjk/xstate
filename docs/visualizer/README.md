# Visualizer

The [XState Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz) is a tool for creating and inspecting statecharts to visualize the state of your applications.

As a visual tool, the Visualizer helps developers get an overview of their application logic, as well as making it easy to share and with designers, project managers and the rest of the team.

[Video introducing the viz basics]

- _Write_ your application logic and immediately visualize it.
- _Save_ your statecharts to the Stately Registry and share them with anybody.
- _Share_ your statecharts in your team’s documentation with embedded mode and live-updating snapshot images.
