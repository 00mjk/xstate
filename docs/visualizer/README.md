# Visualizer

The [XState Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz) is a tool for creating statecharts to manage the state of your applications.

As a visual tool, the Visualizer helps developers get an overview of their application logic, as well as making it easy to share and with designers, project managers and the rest of the team.
